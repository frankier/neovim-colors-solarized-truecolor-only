This is a version of https://github.com/altercation/vim-colors-solarized
modified to always use true color (24 bit rgb). This means it will work with
neovim-qt with the following:

In file `~/.config/nvim/ginit.vim` :

    set termguicolors
    set background=light " or dark
    colorscheme solarized_nvimqt
    
For Neovim terminal version, in file `~/.config/nvim/init.vim`, keep :
    
    set background=light " or dark
    colorscheme solarized

For more info see the original.
